*Solution: Import more conversations with clear decisions*

**High Hallucination Rate**
```bash
# Run hallucination detection
python scripts/test_accuracy.py test --test-type hallucination --workspace-id 1
```
*Solution: Strengthen source validation in prompts*

**Inconsistent Results**
```bash
# Test consistency
python scripts/test_accuracy.py test --test-type consistency --workspace-id 1
```
*Solution: Reduce temperature, improve prompt determinism*

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable for detailed logging:
```bash
export ACCURACY_DEBUG=true
python scripts/test_accuracy.py validate --workspace-id 1
```

**Remember**: You can't build perfect AI accuracy alone, but you can build good enough accuracy with smart systems that improve automatically. Focus on building feedback loops that make your AI smarter over time rather than trying to perfect it before launch.

**Launch with 85% accuracy, strong disclaimers, and excellent improvement systems - that beats 95% accuracy that never ships.**
